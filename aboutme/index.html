    <h3>Jefferson or Jeff</h3>
    <p>Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself. I'm from Sao Paulo, Brazil, 
        but right now I'm living in the State of Minas Gerais in a small city called Patos de Minas. 
        I am married to a wonderful woman, two months from now we will complete 10 years since we got married. 
        We have a son, he is a 2 years and 8 months little boy, he is smart and brings so much joy to our lives. 
        I work with accounting. I love airplanes and cooking. 
    </p>
